  <center><h1>Minar-e-Pakistan</h1></center>
  <h1>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h1>
  <p>The tower was built between 1960 and 1968 on the site where the
     All-India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution
      (which was later called the Pakistan Resolution) 
      on 23 March 1940 â€“ the first official call for
       a separate and independent homeland for the Muslims
        of British India, as espoused by the two-nation theory.
         The resolution eventually helped lead to the creation of Pakistan in 1947.
The tower is located in the middle of an urban park, called the Greater Iqbal Park.</p>

<h1>Design</h1>
<p>The tower reflects a blend of Mughal/Islamic and modern architecture.
The tower was designed and supervised by, Nasreddin Murat-Khan,
 a Russian-born Pakistani architect and civil engineer.
The minaret provides a panoramic view to visitors who can access
 the top by climbing up the stairs or by means of an elevator.
The tower base is shaped like a flower. 
The area surrounding the monument is covered with parks and flowers.
 The location is often used for political and religious events. 
 It is also known as the "Liberty Tower of Pakistan</p>

    <h1>Structure</h1>
    The base is about 8 metres above the ground. 
      The tower rises about 62 metres on the base, 
        and the total height of the Minar is about 70 metres above the ground. 
        The unfolding petals of the flower-like base are 9 metres high.
         The diameter of the tower is about 9.75 meters. 
         The rostrum is built of patterned tiles, and faces Badshahi Mosque. 
         The base consists of four platforms.
          To symbolise the humble beginning of the struggle for freedom,
           the first platform is built with uncut stones from Taxila, 
           the second platform is made of hammer-dressed stones,
            and the third platform is made of chiselled stones.
             Polished white marble used for the fourth and final platform 
             depicts the success of the Pakistan Movement.
              The structure uses the imagery of crescents and stars,
               signs that symbolize the culture of Pakistan,
         similarly seen in the National Flag.
